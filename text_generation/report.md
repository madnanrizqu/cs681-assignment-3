# Text Generation: Comparative Analysis of Neural Network Architectures for Creative Content Generation

## 1. Introduction

We implement and compare three different neural network architectures for text generation:

- Standard RNN (using GRU cells)
- LSTM-based model
- Transformer-based model

Our analysis evaluates these models on metrics including perplexity, coherence, and qualitative assessment of generated text samples.

## 2. Dataset Description

### 2.1. Source and Preparation

We used a corpus of literary texts from Project Gutenberg containing approximately 5 million words. The dataset consists of classic novels and short stories in the public domain, providing rich and diverse language patterns for our models to learn.

Sample from the dataset:

```
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age 
of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season 
of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.
```

### 2.2. Data Preprocessing

All three models employ the same preprocessing pipeline to ensure fair comparison:

1. **Text normalization**:
   - Conversion to lowercase
   - Unicode normalization (NFKD)
   - Regular expression filtering to keep alphanumeric characters and basic punctuation
   - Adding spaces around punctuation marks

2. **Tokenization**:
   - Adding special tokens `[START]` and `[END]` to mark sequence boundaries
   - Converting tokens to integer indices using a vocabulary dictionary

3. **Vocabulary management**:
   - Limited vocabulary size to 10,000 most frequent tokens
   - Out-of-vocabulary tokens handled with `[UNK]` token

4. **Dataset splits**:
   - 80% training / 10% validation / 10% test split
   - Consistent data batching with size of 64 examples per batch
   - Sequence length of 100 tokens for each training example

## 3. Model Architectures

### 3.1. Common Components

- **Embedding layer**: Maps token indices to dense vector representations
- **Output layer**: Dense layer with softmax activation for next-token prediction

### 3.2. Model-Specific Components

#### 3.2.1. Standard RNN (GRU)

```python
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units,
                        return_sequences=True,
                        recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
```

The GRU model uses Gated Recurrent Units which help address the vanishing gradient problem while being computationally more efficient than LSTM units. The model processes text sequentially, maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous tokens.

#### 3.2.2. LSTM Model

```python
self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units,
                        return_sequences=True,
                        recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
```

The LSTM model uses Long Short-Term Memory units which include additional gating mechanisms (input gate, forget gate, and output gate) to better capture long-range dependencies in text. The cell state provides a pathway for information to flow through the network with minimal degradation.

#### 3.2.3. Transformer Model

```python
self.encoder = TransformerEncoder(
    num_layers=4,
    d_model=units,
    num_heads=8,
    dff=units*4,
    input_vocab_size=vocab_size,
    maximum_position_encoding=5000)
```

The Transformer model relies on self-attention mechanisms rather than recurrence. It processes all tokens in parallel, computing attention weights between each token and all other tokens in the sequence. This architecture can capture dependencies regardless of distance and scales better for longer contexts.

## 4. Training Methodology

### 4.1. Hyperparameters

All models were trained with the following consistent hyperparameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Embedding dimensions | 256 |
| Hidden units | 512 |
| Batch size | 64 |
| Maximum vocabulary size | 10,000 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Learning rate | 0.001 with cosine decay |
| Training epochs | 10 (with early stopping) |
| Steps per epoch | 200 |
| Validation steps | 50 |
| Early stopping patience | 3 |

### 4.2. Loss Function and Metrics

We used categorical cross-entropy loss to train all models:

```python
def masked_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Calculate the loss for each item in the batch
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(
        from_logits=True, reduction='none')
    loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
    
    # Mask off the losses on padding
    mask = tf.cast(y_true != 0, loss.dtype)
    loss *= mask
    
    # Return the total
    return tf.reduce_sum(loss)/tf.reduce_sum(mask)

def perplexity(y_true, y_pred):
    loss = masked_loss(y_true, y_pred)
    return tf.exp(loss)
```

### 4.3. Training Process

All models were trained using teacher forcing, where the ground truth from the previous time step is provided as input to the next time step during training. For the Transformer model, we used masking to prevent the model from seeing future tokens during training.

Each model was trained with an early stopping callback monitoring validation loss to prevent overfitting, with a patience of 3 epochs.

## 5. Evaluation Methods

### 5.1. Quantitative Evaluation

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Perplexity**: Measures how well the model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.
2. **Token-level accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted next tokens on the test set.
3. **Sample diversity**: Entropy of generated tokens to measure the variety in the model's outputs.

### 5.2. Qualitative Evaluation

We performed qualitative analysis through:

1. **Human evaluation**: Three independent evaluators rated generated passages on coherence, creativity, and grammatical correctness.
2. **Text completion task**: Models were given identical prompts and asked to generate 100 tokens of continuation.
3. **Temperature sampling**: We explored how different sampling temperatures (0.7, 1.0, 1.2) affected the quality and diversity of generated text.

## 6. Results and Analysis

### 6.1. Quantitative Results

The following table summarizes the performance metrics across all three models:

| LSTM | XX.XX | 0.XX | XX ms/token |
