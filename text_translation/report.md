# Neural Machine Translation: Comparative Analysis of RNN Architectures for English-Indonesian Translation

## 1. Introduction

We implement and compare three different neural network architectures:

- Standard RNN (using GRU cells)
- LSTM-based model
- Bidirectional LSTM model

Our analysis evaluates these models on metrics including translation accuracy, BLEU scores, and qualitative assessment of generated translations.

## 2. Dataset Description

### 2.1. Source and Preparation

We used an English-Indonesian parallel corpus containing approximately 13,500 sentence pairs from manything. Each entry in the dataset consists of an English sentence and its corresponding Indonesian translation. The dataset format uses tab-separated values with the English text in the first column and Indonesian text in the second column.

Sample from the dataset:

```
English: Tom is a good swimmer.
Indonesian: Tom adalah perenang yang baik.
```

### 2.2. Data Preprocessing

All three models employ the same preprocessing pipeline to ensure fair comparison:

1. **Text normalization**:
   - Conversion to lowercase
   - Unicode normalization (NFKD)
   - Regular expression filtering to keep alphanumeric characters and basic punctuation
   - Adding spaces around punctuation marks

2. **Tokenization**:
   - Adding special tokens `[START]` and `[END]` to mark sequence boundaries
   - Converting tokens to integer indices using a vocabulary dictionary

3. **Vocabulary management**:
   - Limited vocabulary size to 5,000 most frequent tokens for both source and target languages
   - Out-of-vocabulary tokens handled with `[UNK]` token

4. **Dataset splits**:
   - 80% training / 20% validation split
   - Consistent data batching with size of 64 examples per batch

## 3. Model Architectures

All three models follow an encoder-decoder architecture with attention, but differ in the type of recurrent units used.

### 3.1. Common Components

- **Embedding layer**: Maps token indices to dense vector representations
- **Encoder**: Processes source language sentences
- **Decoder**: Generates target language translations
- **Output layer**: Dense layer with softmax activation

### 3.2. Model-Specific Components

#### 3.2.1. Standard RNN (GRU)

```python
# Encoder
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units,
                        return_sequences=True,
                        recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')

# Decoder
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units,
                             return_sequences=True,
                             return_state=True,
                             recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
```

The GRU model uses Gated Recurrent Units which help address the vanishing gradient problem while being computationally more efficient than LSTM units.

#### 3.2.2. LSTM Model

```python
# Encoder
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units,
                        return_sequences=True,
                        recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')

# Decoder
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units,
                             return_sequences=True,
                             return_state=True,
                             recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
```

The LSTM model uses Long Short-Term Memory units which include additional gating mechanisms to better capture long-range dependencies.

**Attention mechanism**: Cross-attention with 4 attention heads

#### 3.2.3. Bidirectional LSTM

```python
# Encoder
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(
    merge_mode='sum',
    layer=tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units,
                        return_sequences=True,
                        recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform'))

# Decoder
# Standard LSTM for decoder as bidirectional processing
# is not applicable for autoregressive decoding
self.rnn = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units,
                              return_sequences=True,
                              return_state=True,
                              recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
```

The Bidirectional LSTM processes the input sequence in both forward and backward directions, allowing it to capture contextual information from both past and future states at any given point in the sequence.

**Attention mechanism**: Cross-attention with 4 attention heads

## 4. Training Methodology

### 4.1. Hyperparameters

All models were trained with the following consistent hyperparameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Embedding dimensions | 256 |
| Hidden units | 256 |
| Batch size | 64 |
| Maximum vocabulary size | 5,000 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Training epochs | 5 (with early stopping) |
| Steps per epoch | 100 |
| Validation steps | 20 |
| Early stopping patience | 3 |

### 4.2. Loss Function and Metrics

We used custom masked loss and accuracy functions to handle padded sequences:

```python
def masked_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Calculate the loss for each item in the batch
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(
        from_logits=True, reduction='none')
    loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
    
    # Mask off the losses on padding
    mask = tf.cast(y_true != 0, loss.dtype)
    loss *= mask
    
    # Return the total
    return tf.reduce_sum(loss)/tf.reduce_sum(mask)

def masked_acc(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    y_pred = tf.cast(y_pred, y_true.dtype)
    
    match = tf.cast(y_true == y_pred, tf.float32)
    mask = tf.cast(y_true != 0, tf.float32)
    
    return tf.reduce_sum(match)/tf.reduce_sum(mask)
```

### 4.3. Training Process

All models were trained using teacher forcing, where the ground truth from the previous time step is provided as input to the next time step during training, regardless of the model's prediction. This approach helps stabilize training.

Each model was trained with an early stopping callback monitoring validation loss to prevent overfitting, with a patience of 3 epochs.

## 5. Evaluation Methods

### 5.1. Quantitative Evaluation

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Test set masked accuracy**: Custom metric that ignores padding tokens when calculating accuracy
2. **BLEU score**: Industry-standard metric for evaluating machine translation quality
   - For shorter sentences (<4 tokens), we used BLEU-1 (unigram precision)
   - For longer sentences, we used standard BLEU-4 (weighted average of 1-4 gram precision)
   - We averaged BLEU scores accros 100 samples in the test set

### 5.2. Qualitative Evaluation

We performed qualitative analysis by examining random samples of translations from the test set, comparing model outputs against reference translations for fluency, adequacy, and grammatical correctness.

## 6. Results and Analysis

### 6.1. Quantitative Results

The following table summarizes the performance metrics across all three models:

| Model | Test Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | BLEU Score |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| Standard RNN (GRU) | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX |
| LSTM | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX |
| Bidirectional LSTM | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX |

*Note: The actual metrics would be filled in after running each notebook*

### 6.2. Training Dynamics
